# Cow-Pain-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to detect pain or no pain in cows based on images of their faces and bodies. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Visual Transformers, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures to classify cow images into two categories: Pain and No Pain.
